![](game.gif)

# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

The owner of the local game shop is an enthusiast of classic computer games. He has been looking for a talented programmer that can help him revive his passion for text-based games. He has few requirements for this task:

1. The game has to be entirely text-based.
2. The game must record the time played.
3. The game must record the player name and score.

Apart for this requirements, the owner is open to any type of game, topic or genre.

## Proposed Solution

I chose a Multiple Choice Quiz game (with 3 answers choices: a, b or c) to limit the amount of typing errors from the players that might affect the score counts compared to a normal quiz game where the user has to type their direct answers.
In my opinion, the game is appropriate for users 12+ as the questions and answers are straight forward and with a limited choice of answers.
I chose this game because it is intelectual and can help in the development of general knowledge. The additional facts that are added at the end of each questions may also teach something new to the players.
Moreover, it is multiplayer so 2 friends can play together and see which one of them knows the most random facts. 

## Success Criteria
1. The game has to be entirely text-based.
2. The game must record the time played.
3. The game must record the player name and score.
4. The game must be multiplayer
5. The questions will have simple vocabulary
6. Answers will be multiple choice

# Criteria B: Design
The game consists of 2 people answering random questions and trying to get the most answers right.
The game has a timer to record the time played and the questions are straight forward. 
The scores are recorded (1 point for each question) and at the end of the game, the person with the highest score
wins.
The database will register the players' names and scores too.
