# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

The owner of the local game shop is an enthusiast of classic computer games. He has been looking for a talented programmer that can help him revive his passion for text-based games. He has few requirements for this task:

1. The game has to be entirely text-based.
2. The game must record the time played.
3. The game must record the player name and score.

Apart for this requirements, the owner is open to any type of game, topic or genre.

## Design Statement:
I will to design and make a Quiz game for a client who is the owner of a local game shop. The game will be intelectual and about general knowledge and is constructed using the software Pycharm. It will take 1 month to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria ———.

## Proposed Solution

I chose a Multiple Choice Quiz game (with 3 answers choices: a, b or c) to limit the amount of typing errors from the players that might affect the score counts compared to a normal quiz game where the user has to type their direct answers.
In my opinion, the game is appropriate for users 12+ as the questions and answers are straight forward and with a limited choice of answers.
I chose this game because it is intelectual and can help in the development of general knowledge. The additional facts that are added at the end of each questions may also teach something new to the players.
Moreover, it is multiplayer so 2 friends can play together and see which one of them knows the most random facts. 

## Success Criteria
1. The game has to be entirely text-based.
2. The game must record the time played.
3. The game must record the player name and score.
4. The game must be multiplayer
5. The questions will have simple vocabulary
6. Answers will be multiple choice
